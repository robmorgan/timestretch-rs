# Reference Audio Benchmark Manifest
#
# Each [[track]] entry describes an original audio file and one or more
# professionally time-stretched reference files. The benchmark runner loads
# these, processes the original with each EDM preset, and compares the output
# against the professional references using spectral and temporal metrics.
#
# Audio files are NOT checked into git (see .gitignore). Place them under
# benchmarks/audio/ as described in benchmarks/README.md.

# --- Example track entry (uncomment and adjust for your files) ---
