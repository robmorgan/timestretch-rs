# Reference Audio Benchmark Manifest
#
# Each [[track]] entry describes an original audio file and one or more
# professionally time-stretched reference files. The benchmark runner loads
# these, processes the original with each EDM preset, and compares the output
# against the professional references using spectral and temporal metrics.
#
# Audio files are NOT checked into git (see .gitignore). Place them under
# benchmarks/audio/ as described in benchmarks/README.md.

# --- Example track entry (uncomment and adjust for your files) ---
#
# [[track]]
# id = "deep-house-loop-01"
# description = "4-bar deep house loop, 124 BPM, stereo"
# original = "originals/deep-house-loop-01.wav"
# bpm = 124.0
#
#   [[track.reference]]
#   file = "references/deep-house-loop-01_128bpm_ableton.wav"
#   target_bpm = 128.0
#   software = "Ableton Live 11"
#   algorithm = "Complex Pro"
#
#   [[track.reference]]
#   file = "references/deep-house-loop-01_128bpm_serato.wav"
#   target_bpm = 128.0
#   software = "Serato DJ Pro"
#   algorithm = "Default"
