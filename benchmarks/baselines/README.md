# Baseline Reports

This directory stores archived JSON reports produced by:

```bash
./benchmarks/run_m0_baseline.sh
```

Files:

- `m0_baseline_latest.json`: most recent baseline snapshot.
- `m0_baseline_<UTC timestamp>.json`: immutable point-in-time archive.

These reports are metric-only (no audio payloads) and are used for milestone-to-baseline comparisons.
