# Progress

## Completed — Phase 1: Foundation (agent-3)
- [x] Cargo.toml with `rustfft` dependency, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
- [x] Core types: `AudioBuffer`, `Sample`, `Channels`, `StretchParams`, `EdmPreset`
- [x] Error types: `StretchError` enum with descriptive variants
- [x] Window functions: Hann, Blackman-Harris, Kaiser-Bessel (with Bessel I0 series expansion)
- [x] WAV reader: 16-bit PCM, 24-bit PCM, 32-bit float IEEE
- [x] WAV writer: 16-bit PCM and 32-bit float
- [x] Linear and cubic (Hermite) resampling

## Completed — Phase 2: Algorithms (agent-3)
- [x] Phase vocoder with identity phase locking and sub-bass phase locking
- [x] WSOLA with normalized cross-correlation matching
- [x] Transient detector: spectral flux with adaptive threshold, HF-weighted bins (2-8kHz)
- [x] Beat detection with BPM estimation and grid quantization

## Completed — Phase 3: EDM Optimization (agent-3)
- [x] Hybrid stretcher: transient-aware switching between WSOLA and PV
- [x] Crossfade engine: raised-cosine crossfade between algorithm segments
- [x] Frequency band splitter (sub/low/mid/high)
- [x] All 5 EDM presets: DjBeatmatch, HouseLoop, Halftime, Ambient, VocalChop

## Completed — Phase 4: Streaming & API (agent-3)
- [x] `StreamProcessor` with chunk-based processing
- [x] Real-time stretch ratio changes (smooth interpolation)
- [x] Latency reporting API
- [x] Public API: `stretch()`, `stretch_buffer()`, builder pattern for params
- [x] CLI binary (behind `cli` feature flag)

## Completed — Phase 5: Testing (agent-3)
- [x] 64 unit tests across all modules
- [x] 4 identity tests (mono, stereo, 48kHz, all presets)
- [x] 5 quality tests (RMS preservation, length proportionality, clipping, DJ quality, sub-bass)
- [x] 6 EDM preset integration tests
- [x] 6 streaming tests (basic, stereo, ratio change, reset, small chunks, latency)
- [x] 1 doc-test
- [x] Total: 86 tests, all passing
- [x] Zero clippy warnings

## TODO
- [ ] Write performance benchmarks
- [ ] Optimize hot paths (SIMD-friendly layout, allocation avoidance in process loop)
- [ ] More comprehensive identity test (bit-exact where possible)
- [ ] Test with real audio samples
- [ ] Improve WSOLA compression ratio accuracy (currently undershoots for ratio < 0.5)

## Notes
- Hann window used for all PV processing (works well for EDM kicks)
- Phase vocoder window-sum normalization clamped to prevent amplification in low-overlap regions
- For very short segments, hybrid falls back to linear resampling
- WSOLA cross-correlation is time-domain (not FFT-accelerated yet)
